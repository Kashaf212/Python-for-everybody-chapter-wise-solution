Statement

Write a simple program to simulate the operation of the
grep command on Unix. Ask the user to enter a regular expression and
count the number of lines that matched the regular expression:
$ python grep.py
Enter a regular expression: ^Author
mbox.txt had 1798 lines that matched ^Author
$ python grep.py
Enter a regular expression: ^Xmbox.txt had 14368 lines that matched ^X-
$ python grep.py
Enter a regular expression: java$
mbox.txt had 4175 lines that matched java$


Solution


import re
f=open("C:\code\mbox.txt")
data=input("Enter a regular expression:")
count=0
for lines in f:
    line=lines.rstrip()
    x=re.findall(data,line)
    if len(x)>0:
        count+=1
print(f"There are {count} lines which contain the word {data}")
