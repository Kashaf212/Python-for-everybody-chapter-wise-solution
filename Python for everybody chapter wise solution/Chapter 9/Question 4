Solution

file_name=input("Enter a file name:")
email_counting=dict()
try:
    f=open(file_name)
except:
    print("can't open the file")
    quit()
for lines in f:
    if lines.startswith("From:"):
           words=lines.split()
           email_counting[words[1]]=email_counting.get(words[1],0)+1
emails=list(email_counting.values())
emails.sort()
print(emails)
for values in emails:
    maximum=max(emails)
for keys,values in email_counting.items():
    if values==maximum:
        print(keys,maximum)
