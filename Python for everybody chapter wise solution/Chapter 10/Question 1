Statement

Revise a previous program as follows: Read and parse the
“From” lines and pull out the addresses from the line. Count the number of messages from each person using a dictionary.
After all the data has been read, print the person with the most commits
by creating a list of (count, email) tuples from the dictionary. Then
sort the list in reverse order and print out the person who has the most
commits.

    f=open(file_name)
except:
    print("can't open the file")
    quit()
for lines in f:
