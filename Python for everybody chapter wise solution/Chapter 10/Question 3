Statement

Write a program that reads a file and prints the letters
in decreasing order of frequency. Your program should convert all the
input to lower case and only count the letters a-z. Your program should
not count spaces, digits, punctuation, or anything other than the letters
a-z. Find text samples from several different languages and see how
letter frequency varies between languages. Compare your results with
the tables at https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Letter_frequencies.


Solution

frequency=dict()
import string
f=open("C:\code\Romeo.txt")
for lines in f:
    line=lines.translate(str.maketrans('','',string.punctuation))
    line=lines.translate(str.maketrans("","",string.digits))
    line=line.lower()
    words=line.split()
    for word in words:
        letter=word.split()
        for letter in word:
             frequency[letter]=frequency.get(letter,0)+1
list_name=list(frequency.items())
list_name.sort()
for keys,values in list_name:
    print(keys,values)
