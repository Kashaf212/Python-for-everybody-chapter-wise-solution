Statement

Assume that we execute the following assignment statements:
width = 17
height = 12.0
For each of the following expressions, write the value of the expression and the
type (of the value of the expression).
1. width//2
2. width/2.0
3. height/3
4. 1 + 2 * 5
Use the Python interpreter to check your answers.


Solution

width = 17
height = 12.0
quotient= width//2
division= width/2.0
div=height/3
expression= 1 + 2 * 5
print("quotient:",quotient,"\n",type(quotient))
print("division:",division,"\n",type(division))
print("div:",div,"\n",type(div))
print("expression:",expression,"\n",type(expression))
