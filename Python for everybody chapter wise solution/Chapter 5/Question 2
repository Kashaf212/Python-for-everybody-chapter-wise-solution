Write another program that prompts for a list of numbers
as above and at the end prints out both the maximum and minimum of
the numbers instead of the average.


Solution

num=[]
total=0
count=0
while True:
    number=input("Enter a number:")
    try:
         if number=="done":
             print(total,count,max(num),min(num))
             break
         number=int(number)
         num.append(number)
         total=total+number
         count=count+1
    except:
        print("Invalid Input")
