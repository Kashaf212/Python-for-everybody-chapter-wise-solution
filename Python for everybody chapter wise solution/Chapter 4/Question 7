Statement

Rewrite the grade program from the previous chapter using
a function called computegrade that takes a score as its parameter and
returns a grade as a string.
Score Grade
>= 0.9 A
>= 0.8 B
>= 0.7 C
>= 0.6 D
< 0.6 F
Enter score: 0.95
A
Enter score: perfect
Bad score
Enter score: 10.0
Bad score
Enter score: 0.75
C
Enter score: 0.5
F
Run the program repeatedly to test the various different values for input



Solution


score=input("Enter Score:")
def computegrade():
    if score>=0.0 and score<=1.0:
        if score>=0.9:
            return("Grade A")
        elif score>=0.8:
            return("Grade B")
        elif score>=0.7:
            return("Grade C")
        elif score<0.6:
            return("Grade F")
        else:
            return("its an erorr")

try:
    score = float(score)
except:
    print("can't interpret")
    quit()
Grades=computegrade()
print(Grades)
